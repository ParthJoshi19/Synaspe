# Design Guidelines: Quantum-Federated Multimodal RAG System

## Design Approach
**Futuristic Research-Grade AI System** - A cutting-edge interface that simulates quantum-enhanced federated learning with multimodal document retrieval across text, image, audio, and video inputs.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Dark Mode Theme:**
- Background: #0A0F1C (deep space blue-black)
- Primary Accent: #7A5FFF (quantum purple)
- Secondary Accent: #00E0FF (electric cyan)
- Surface: #1B263B (dark slate)
- Glowing gradients combining blue/purple quantum-style effects

### B. Typography
- Primary: Inter or Poppins (UI elements)
- Monospace: Roboto Mono (console, technical displays)
- Futuristic, clean, highly readable typography

### C. Visual Effects
- Animated particle or neural-network background
- Smooth transitions with shimmer/blur effects
- Glowing circuit animations for quantum nodes
- Rotating sphere loaders for retrieval processes
- Terminal-style log displays with typing effects

### D. Layout System
Tailwind spacing: Use units of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 for consistent quantum-grid alignment.

## Page-Specific Guidelines

### 1. Login Page
- Centered card with quantum glow effect
- Title: "Welcome to Quantum-Federated Multimodal RAG System"

- Top status bar: "Offline Intelligence: Active | Quantum Engine: Ready | Privacy: 98.7% Secure"
- Center content area with drag-and-drop upload zone

**Upload Section:**
- Large drop zone for PDF, Image, Video, Audio files
- Animated progress bars showing:
  - "Extracting Multimodal Featuresâ€¦"
  - "Federated Embedding in Progressâ€¦"
  - "Quantum Similarity Optimizationâ€¦"
- Icons: AI, cloud-off, lock, brain, video (Lucide/Material)

### 3. Query Interface
- Large text input: "Summarize the uploaded research paper and find related visuals"
- Toggle buttons for Text/Image/Video/Audio query types
- "Retrieving Results from Quantum-Federated Nodesâ€¦" loader with animated rotating spheres
- Glowing submit button with quantum pulse effect

### 4. Results Display
**Multimodal Result Cards:**
- PDF: Highlighted snippet preview with page indicators
- Image: Thumbnail with AI-generated caption
- Video: Still frame with timestamp markers
- Audio: Waveform visualization with transcript snippet
- Each card shows: Confidence Score + Quantum Entanglement Factor badges
- Cards arranged in responsive grid with hover glow effects

### 5. Result Explanation Page
**Title:** "Cross-Modal Insight Generation"

**Tabs:**
- Semantic Summary
- Quantum Similarity Map (3D visualization)
- Federated Privacy Metrics

**Mock Visualizations:**
- 3D embedding sphere visualization (overlapping Text/Image/Audio spheres)
- Retrieval performance bar chart (latency reduction)
- Privacy score donut chart (95%+)
- Buttons: "Re-run Query" | "Export Report" | "View Transparency Graph"

### 6. Quantum Console (Advanced Tab)
- Terminal-style window with dark background
- Simulated logs with syntax highlighting:
  ```
  [Quantum Node 3 Initialized]
  [Federated NAS Search Running...]
  [Similarity Optimization Î”E=0.00412]
  [Cross-modal alignment achieved at 98.76%]
  ```
- "View Logs" and "Pause Simulation" buttons
- Blinking cursor effect for realism

## Interactive Behavior Simulation

### Loaders & Transitions
- 2-3 second animated loaders when switching tabs
- "Retrieving data from local knowledge nodesâ€¦" messages
- Smooth fade transitions between states

### Success Notifications
- Toast popups: "âœ… Quantum Node 4 optimized successfully"
- Privacy updates: "ðŸ”’ Federated Privacy Model updated"
- Final success: "Insight Generated Successfully â€“ 99.3% Confidence"

### Status Indicators
- Live system status in top bar with pulsing indicators
- Progress percentages during processing
- Real-time quantum node sync animations

## Component Library

### Buttons
- Primary: Glowing gradient with quantum pulse on hover
- Secondary: Outlined with neon glow
- Console: Monospace with terminal aesthetic

### Cards
- Frosted glass effect with subtle border glow
- Hover state: Increased glow intensity
- Shadow depth for elevation hierarchy

### Inputs
- Futuristic border with focus glow animation
- Placeholder text in accent color
- File upload with animated border on drag-over

### Data Visualization
- Glowing line charts with gradient fills
- Animated donut charts with percentage labels
- 3D sphere visualizations with orbit controls

## Key UI Text & Messaging

**Splash:** "Empowering Offline Intelligence through Quantum Federated AI"

**Insight Card:** "Detected thematic overlap between uploaded research and visual dataset â€” semantic alignment score: 0.982"

**Tooltip:** "Quantum-enhanced similarity calculation reduces retrieval time by 78%"

## Images
No hero images required - use animated particle backgrounds and neural network visualizations instead. All visual interest comes from gradients, glowing effects, and animated data visualizations.
